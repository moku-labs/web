# content

> **Node-only** — the Markdown content layer: discover article sources, parse YAML frontmatter, compute reading time, render to security-hardened HTML, and expose a locale-keyed `Article` model.

`content` owns the article model and its orchestration: locale fallback, draft filtering, date-descending sort, stable `contentId` assignment, the in-memory article cache, and notification events. It is **provider-driven** — exactly like `env`. The plugin *shell* (`api.ts`, `state.ts`, `config.ts`, `validate.ts`) imports zero node code and is browser-safe; all source I/O and the actual Markdown pipeline (gray-matter → unified → Shiki → sanitize) live in a [`ContentProvider`](#dependencies) you compose. The built-in `fileSystemContent` provider is the Node source — and the *only* module that touches `node:fs` and the pipeline — which is why this plugin is classed Node-only even though `contentPlugin` itself ships in the browser bundle.

Routes pull it via `ctx.require(contentPlugin)` inside build-only loaders, and apps reach it at `app.content`. It [depends on `i18n`](../i18n/README.md) for the active locale set and the default-locale fallback source. Lifecycle stance: **pure in-process compute** — `onInit` only (a fail-fast config check), no `onStart`/`onStop`. There is no live resource to warm or release; the costly unified/Shiki processor is a lazy singleton built on first use and parked inside the *provider's* closure, never on plugin state.

## Example

```ts
import { createApp, contentPlugin, fileSystemContent } from "@moku-labs/web";

const app = createApp({
  plugins: [contentPlugin], // node-only — add it explicitly for a build
  pluginConfigs: {
    i18n: { locales: ["en", "uk"], defaultLocale: "en" },
    content: {
      providers: [
        fileSystemContent({
          contentDir: "./content", // article root: content/<slug>/<locale>.md
          shikiTheme: "github-dark",
          defaultAuthor: "Ada"
        })
      ]
    }
  }
});

// All articles, per locale, date-descending (emits content:ready)
const byLocale = await app.content.loadAll();

// One article with locale fallback (uk → en) and full pipeline render
const article = await app.content.load("intro", "uk");
const card = app.content.articleToCard(article); // lightweight, no HTML
```

## API

Reached via `app.content` or `ctx.require(contentPlugin)`.

| Method | Signature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `loadAll` | `() => Promise<Map<string, Article[]>>` | Load every article across every active locale. Applies locale fallback, excludes drafts **in production only**, sorts date-descending, assigns `contentId`, caches, and emits `content:ready`. |
| `load` | `(slug: string, locale: string) => Promise<Article>` | Resolve + render one article with locale fallback. Throws a `[web] content` not-found error if neither the requested-locale nor default-locale file exists. In production a `draft` throws the **same** not-found error (drafts are indistinguishable from missing). |
| `renderMarkdown` | `(md: string) => Promise<string>` | Render a raw Markdown fragment to HTML through the full provider pipeline. |
| `invalidate` | `(paths: readonly string[]) => void` | Mark file paths stale for incremental dev rebuilds: fans invalidation to the provider and drops affected slugs from the cache. Empty/whitespace paths are ignored. Emits `content:invalidated`. |
| `articleToCard` | `(article: Article) => ArticleCard` | Pure projection of an `Article` to a lightweight card (no rendered HTML) for lists/grids. |
| `contentDir` | `() => string` | The configured content source directory (from the first provider, e.g. `"./content"`). Lets a build copy each article's co-located assets (`<contentDir>/<slug>/images/`). |

The `Article` model: `{ frontmatter, computed, html, locale, isFallback, url }`. `frontmatter` carries the authored fields (`title`, `date`, `description`, `tags`, `language`, optional `draft`/`author`); `computed` carries `{ slug, readingTime, contentId, status, wordCount }`. On fallback, `locale` and `url` stay the *requested* locale while `isFallback` is `true`.

## Configuration

`pluginConfigs.content` — one required field.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `providers` | `ContentProvider[]` | `[]` | Ordered content sources. Compose **at least one** (e.g. `fileSystemContent(...)`); the empty default is rejected at `onInit`. First provider to supply a slug+locale wins; `slugs()` are unioned across providers. |

Per-source options live on the provider, not here. The Node `fileSystemContent(options)` factory takes `FileSystemContentOptions`:

| Option | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contentDir` | `string` | — (required) | Absolute or project-relative path to the article root. |
| `trustedContent` | `boolean` | `false` | SECURITY GATE. When `false`, `rehype-sanitize` runs as the final step. Set `true` only for fully author-controlled Markdown — it skips sanitize entirely. |
| `shikiTheme` | `BundledTheme \| ThemeRegistrationAny` | `"github-dark"` | Passed straight to `@shikijs/rehype`. |
| `defaultAuthor` | `string` | `undefined` | Applied to articles whose frontmatter omits `author`. |
| `extraRemarkPlugins` | `readonly Pluggable[]` | `[]` | Concatenated **after** the framework remark defaults (additive — never replaces them). |
| `extraRehypePlugins` | `readonly Pluggable[]` | `[]` | Concatenated after the custom transforms, before Shiki + sanitize (additive). |
| `mermaid` | `boolean \| MermaidDiagramOptions` | disabled | Build-time [Mermaid diagrams](#mermaid-diagrams): render ```` ```mermaid ```` fences to static inline SVG. **Requires `trustedContent: true`** and the optional peer `mermaid-isomorphic`. |

## Mermaid diagrams

Opt-in, **build-time** rendering of ```` ```mermaid ```` fenced code blocks to static inline SVG — the published page ships zero client-side Mermaid JS. Rendering is delegated to the **optional** peer dependency [`mermaid-isomorphic`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/mermaid-isomorphic) (a headless browser under the hood), which is imported **lazily and only when a document actually contains a mermaid fence** — consumers who never write diagrams pay nothing.

```ts
fileSystemContent({
  contentDir: "./content",
  trustedContent: true, // REQUIRED — see below
  mermaid: true // or: { mermaidConfig: { theme: "dark" } }
});
```

Install the optional dependencies (only apps that enable `mermaid` need this):

```sh
bun add -d mermaid-isomorphic playwright && bunx playwright install chromium
```

- **`trustedContent: true` is required.** Mermaid output is raw inline SVG, which the sanitize pass (the untrusted-content XSS boundary) would strip — `fileSystemContent` rejects the combination at construction. Enable it only for fully author-controlled Markdown.
- Each diagram renders into `<figure class="mermaid-diagram">…<svg …></figure>` — style the wrapper via that class.
- The transform runs at the **mdast** stage, before the remark-rehype bridge, so Shiki never claims the fence; all fences of a document are rendered in **one** batched renderer call, and the renderer (browser) is created once per process.
- A diagram that fails to render **fails the build** with its first line quoted — a broken diagram never ships silently.
- `mermaidConfig` is passed straight through to mermaid-isomorphic's render call (loosely typed `Record<string, unknown>` because the dependency is optional).

## Dependencies

`depends: [i18nPlugin]`. The shell PULLs the `i18n` API via `ctx.require(i18nPlugin)` for `locales()` (which locales `loadAll` iterates) and `defaultLocale()` (the fallback source for `load`). See [`../i18n/README.md`](../i18n/README.md).

`ContentProvider` is the composition seam the shell drives:

| Member | Signature | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | Human-readable, used in diagnostics. |
| `contentDir` | `string` | Surfaced via `api.contentDir()` (`""` for non-filesystem sources). |
| `slugs` | `() => Promise<readonly string[]>` | Discover the slugs this provider can supply. |
| `readArticle` | `(slug, fileLocale, outLocale, isFallback) => Promise<Article \| null>` | Read + render one article; `null` when absent. |
| `render` | `(markdown: string) => Promise<string>` | Render a standalone Markdown string. |
| `invalidate?` | `(paths: readonly string[]) => void` | Optional dev hook to drop stale discovery. |

When more than one provider is composed, the shell collapses them into a single facade: `slugs()` are unioned and sorted, `readArticle`/`render` use first-match, `invalidate` fans out. A single-provider list (the common case) is used directly.

## Events

Notification-only — fetch real data via the API, never off the payload.

| Event | Payload | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `content:ready` | `{ locales: readonly string[]; articleCount: number }` | end of every `loadAll()` |
| `content:invalidated` | `{ paths: readonly string[] }` | every `invalidate(paths)` (only the accepted, non-empty paths) |

## Design notes

### The sanitize-last XSS boundary (`trustedContent`)

`rehype-sanitize` runs as the **last** rehype step — after Shiki highlighting — whenever `trustedContent: false` (the default). Sanitizing last means even the markup Shiki emits is scrubbed, and dangerous payloads (`<script>`, `onerror=`, `javascript:` URLs) are stripped from the output. The extended schema (`pipeline/sanitize.ts`) clones the library default and *additively* allowlists exactly what the framework transforms produce: the `pull-quote`, `section-divider`, and `section-divider-ornament` classes on `aside`/`div`/`span`, `loading="lazy"` on `<img>`, and `class`/`className` globally (`*`) so Shiki's class hooks survive. `style` is deliberately **not** allowed globally — CSS values are not sanitized, so untrusted `style` attributes would enable overlay/exfiltration tricks; it survives only on `pre`/`code` (Shiki's block-level theme colors). Shiki's per-token inline `span` colors are therefore stripped when `trustedContent: false`; use `trustedContent: true` only for fully author-controlled content if you need them.

> [!WARNING]
> `trustedContent: true` **skips** sanitize entirely and trusts all raw HTML in the source. Use it only when the framework author controls 100% of the Markdown (no user-submitted content).

### Additive `extraRemarkPlugins` / `extraRehypePlugins`

The framework default remark/rehype arrays are **hardcoded** in `pipeline/plugins.ts` (wired by `pipeline/markdown.ts`) — never a config-array default. A full-array config key would be *replaced*, not merged, by the shallow plugin-config merge, silently erasing the framework pipeline. Keeping defaults out of config and exposing only additive `extra*` keys means consumer extras are **concatenated** after the defaults, never able to wipe them.

### Lazy processor singleton (in the provider)

The Shiki/unified processor is a **lazy singleton stored on the provider's private `ContentProviderState.processor`** — never on the shell's `ctx.state`, never a module-level cache. It is built on the first `render()`/`readArticle()` via `ensureProcessor(state, options)` inside `fileSystemContent`, then reused. Because it lives in the provider closure, two apps in one process never share one (no cross-app Shiki leak), and `createState`/`onInit` do no async work, keeping `createApp` synchronous.

### Locale fallback & draft filtering (stage-gated)

`load(slug, locale)` prefers the native `<contentDir>/<slug>/<locale>.md` (`isFallback: false`); when absent it falls back to the default-locale file (`isFallback: true`, requested locale retained on `locale`/`url`). Drafts (frontmatter `draft: true` → `computed.status === "draft"`) are excluded by `loadAll` and `load` **only when `global.stage === "production"`** — they load normally in `development` and `test`. In production a draft surfaces as the *identical* not-found error a missing article does, so drafts cannot be probed.

### Computed fields

`readingTime` is `reading-time`'s estimate, `Math.ceil`-ed with a 1-minute floor; `wordCount` is its raw word count. `contentId` is the slug on read, then rewritten by `loadAll` to a sortable `${locale}:${index4}:${slug}` *after* the date sort. `fileSystemContent` also rewrites co-located relative image `src`s (`./images/…` → `/<slug>/images/…`) so they resolve from any locale page. Frontmatter `Date` values are coerced to ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (avoiding timezone shift), and the five required fields throw a `[web] content` error if missing.

## Files

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Wiring harness only (`depends`, `events`, `config`, `createState`, `onInit`, `api`). |
| `types.ts` | `Config`, `State`, `Api`, `Article`, `ArticleCard`, `Frontmatter`, `ComputedFields`, `ContentProvider`, `FileSystemContentOptions`, `MermaidDiagramOptions`, `ContentEvents`, `ContentApiContext`. |
| `config.ts` | `defaultContentConfig` — `{ providers: [] }`. |
| `events.ts` | `contentEvents` register callback. |
| `validate.ts` | `validateContentConfig` — `onInit` fail-fast when no provider is composed — + `validateFileSystemContentOptions` (mermaid ⇒ trustedContent). |
| `state.ts` | `createContentState` — the empty locale-keyed article cache. |
| `api.ts` | `contentApi` (kernel-facing) + `createContentApi` (kernel-free) + `mergeProviders`. All orchestration: fallback, draft filtering, sort, cache, events. Imports zero node code. |
| `providers.ts` | `fileSystemContent` — the Node provider (`node:fs` + pipeline). Root export only, never `/browser`. |
| `pipeline/markdown.ts` | `ensureProcessor` — lazy builder, sanitize-last, extra-plugin concat. |
| `pipeline/plugins.ts` | Framework default remark/rehype arrays + the 3 custom transforms (lazy-images, pull-quote, section-divider). |
| `pipeline/frontmatter.ts` | `parseFrontmatter` (gray-matter, `Date`→ISO, required-field + default handling). |
| `pipeline/reading-time.ts` | `calculateReadingTime`. |
| `pipeline/sanitize.ts` | `buildSanitizeSchema` — the extended rehype-sanitize schema. |
| `pipeline/mermaid.ts` | `remarkMermaidDiagrams` — opt-in build-time mermaid fences → inline SVG (lazy optional dep). |

> [!NOTE]
> The shell (`contentPlugin`) is re-exported from `@moku-labs/web/browser` so build-only loaders can `ctx.require(contentPlugin)` on either side, while `fileSystemContent` is exported **only** from the package root — mirroring the node `env` providers (`dotenv`/`processEnv`).
